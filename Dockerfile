# Bug: container will hang on start unless VOLUME is commented out
# Info: There are many other folders under /usr/local/PPB that probably need to be on a VOLUME:
#   /usr/local/PPB/cert/              (your ssl cert if you enable https)
#   /usr/local/PPB/db_cloud/          (db if using cloud service)
#   /usr/local/PPB/db_local/          (db if not using cloud service)
#   /usr/local/PPB/etc/               (some test logs)
#   /usr/local/PPB/extcmd/            (*.sh files to run when events happen)
#   /usr/local/PPB/log/               (possibly only installation logs)
#   /usr/local/PPB/temp/              (current version info)
#   /usr/local/PPB/uploads/           (possibly used for importing profile settings)
#   /usr/local/PPB/web/work/local/    (the icons needed for the specific UPS attached)
#   /usr/local/PPB/web-server/local/WEB-INF/classes/static/assets/   (dynamic translations)
# Info: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#notes-about-specifying-volumes
#   "Changing the volume from within the Dockerfile: If any build steps change the data within
#   the volume after it has been declared, those changes will be discarded."
#       Therefore, files in /usr/local/PPB/db_local generated on service start might be lost
# Solution: The volume must be /usr/local/PPB, not /usr/local/PPB/db_local. That means it will
#   also contain ~275 MB of program files that don't need to be in a volume, but the
#   alternative would be setting up ~10 volumes, which is too many.
